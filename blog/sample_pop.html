                Sample vs Population

                <i>I found the Google results of describing the difference between the terms Sample and Population to be lackluster. Hence
                the motivation behind this post.</i>
            </p>
            <p>
                When you're freshly introduced to Stats, you learn a variety of things. You learn about the calculation of the Average, 
                Median, Maximum, Minimum, etc. However, when it comes down to Mean & Variance, you come across an additional term as well.
                And then, you find yourself wondering - what in the <b>world</b> is the difference between <u>Sample</u> and <u>Population</u>
                Mean?
            </p>
            <p>
                <b>1. Mean</b>
            </p>
            <p>
                To put it very simply, Sample Mean refers to a <u>Calculated</u> value while Population Mean is a <u>Theoretical</u> value. 
            </p>
            <p>
                I will illustrate this with an example. For example, for a given Village A (Total population of 3000), we are tasked to obtain the 
                Mean height of the villagers. However, we are only given the height values of 100 such villagers. Given that the villagers'
                weight is denoted by $x_i$ for the $i$-th villager, we know that: $$\frac{\sum_{i=0}^{100}x_i}{(100)}$$
            </p>
            <p>
                is the <b>Sample</b> Mean. 
            </p>
            <p>
                This is because we obtained this Mean using the Sample (Given Dataset) weights.
            </p>
            <p>
                However, the Real, Actual, Theoretical value is known as the <b>Population</b> Mean.
            </p>
            <p>
                <b>2. Variance</b>
            </p>
            <p>
                It is the same for Variance. However, we know that the calculation of Sample vs Population Variance differs by the 
                scalar multiplier. $$\sigma^2 = \frac{\sum(x-\mu)}{N}, $$
